- search and filtering capabilities.
- Secure authentication and user roles (admin, teacher, student).
- Robust PostgreSQL database for data storage.
- Easy-to-use CRUD operations for students, courses, and teachers.

## Technologies Used

- JavaFX 15: For building the graphical user interface.
- PostgreSQL 13: As the relational database management system.
